# Kofax Custom Module

This Custom Module integrates the [Kofax RPA](https://www.kofax.de/-/media/Files/Datasheets/DE/ps_kofax-kapow_de.pdf) with Cognigy.AI

**Secret:**
- Key: api_key
- Value: The Cognigy Request Forwarder API Key

You need this secret to use the request forwarder. This forwarder starts the Kofax Robot and directly sends a `200 Accepted` if nothing gone wrong. So the user can continue chatting with the bot.

## Node: CaptureId

This Node starts the `id-catpure` webchat plugin to let the user capture his or her identity card. This could be the case, if the chatbot needs to collect general personal information such as the first name, last name and address. The plugin hands back all extracted informaton including the cropped image of the identity card itself and the user's personal picture. 


## Node: RunRobot

This Node runs a specific Kofax Robot, which was created in the [Kofax Design Studio](https://www.coforce.nl/kofax-kapow/design-studio/?lang=en). To test Kofax you can get your Trial [here](https://www.kofax.com/Products/Robotic-Process-Automation/Kapow/rpa-free-trial?crmCampaignID=CMP-14638-T2C7F5). \
To start a robot you have to define one. If you don't know how yet, please follow this [Getting Started Video Collection](https://www.kofax.com/Learn/Videos/kofax-rpa-tutorials?utm_campaign=10758&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Eloqua). 

After this, you can upload your built robot to the **Management Console** and get the example **REST API Request** from the `Repository/Robots` section, where you have to click on the **REST** button on the right side of your uploaded robot. You need the **JSON** body for this custom module node: 

``` json
{
    "urlToForward": "ROBOT REST POST URL",
    "bodyToFoward": {
      "THE JSON FORMAT BODY"
    }
  }
```
The `urltoForward` key needs your robot's REST POST REQUEST url, which you can find in the **REST** example in the Management Console. Then you need the **JSON** format body of this example. This will include your variables etc. An example could look like this: 
``` json
{
    "urlToForward": "http://ip:50080/rest/run/Defaultproject/SearchHardware.robot",
    "bodyToFoward": {
      "parameters": [
        {
          "variableName": "searchItem",
          "attribute": [
            {
              "type": "text",
              "name": "searchItem",
              "value": "hammer"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
```

### Calling the Cognigy Injection API
After calling starting the robot with the **RunRobot** node, it won't call Cognigy again or send the stored data to your chat conversation. For this functionality you need the [Inject API](https://docs.cognigy.com/v3.3/reference#post_inject) from Cognigy. There you can send the stored data as a data object. An example request in **Design Studio** could look like the following: 

![Inject API Request](./docs/image2.png)

The variable `jsonPayload` will later contain the entire robot output in the **data** key:

![Json Payload](./docs/image1.png)

For what do you need the keys?
- **userId**: 
    - The robot has to know which user is chatting
- **text**:
    - With this text the robot will inject a message to the flow
    - In this example the intent needs the input text "robot finished" to let the user know that the robot finished his task.
- **sessionId**:
    - Every chat conversation in Cognigy has its own session id, so the robot will know in which conversation he has to inject the message.
- **URLToken**: 
    - Last but not least the Injection API has to know via which endpoint the chat is available now. After the **Endpoint URL** you only have to copy the ID like `81a96c7f83c4d00bb0e604037e894...`.

With this configuration in your Design Studio robot, the robot will inject the live conversation.
