**Properties**

There are two ways to use this Custom Module. Use the [Google Maps Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start) to get the longitude and latitude of the address. 

*IMPORTANT: You need to enable the **Geocoding API** and the **Maps JavaScript API**, while the first one is used to get the latitude and longitude from the search query and the second one to show it with the webchat plugin.*

If the Searchquery field is empty or no Place was found, the module use the default values from Latitude and Longitude. 
Here is an example of a filled google-maps node:
