# General

## Node: soqlQuery 

Takes a [SOQL query string](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.soql_sosl.meta/soql_sosl/sforce_api_calls_soql.htm) and searches for the results in **Salesforce**. An example query would be the following: 

```sql
SELECT Firstname FROM CONTACT
```

```json
"contacts": {
    "totalSize": 33,
    "done": true,
    "records": [
      {
        "attributes": {

# Service Cloud

The following Nodes provide various methods for the [Salesforce Service Cloud](https://www.salesforce.com/de/campaign/sem/service-cloud/).

## Node: Start Live Chat

This node creates a new Salesforce live chat session and chat request. If it returned that `startedLiveChat` equals true, the live agent should received a chat request in the Salesforce Service Console:

```json
"liveChat": {
    "session": {
      "key": "ee809075-...KQt3Z98S+M=",
      "id": "ee809075-...377eaa4d11f0",
      "clientPollTimeout": 40,
      "affinityToken": "84aa1ta1"
    },
    "startedLiveChat": true
  }
```

Inside the **Salesforce Service Console**:

![Chat Request](./docs/chatrequest.png)

## Node: Check Live Agent Availability

Checks whether there is a free agent for the provided live chat button. It returns the following format:

```json
"available": {
    "messages": [
      {
        "type": "Availability",
        "message": {
          "results": [
            {
              "id": "5733f000000sdfgd",
              "isAvailable": true
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
```

In order to get the information, you have to turn on that an agent can **decline a chat request** in Salesforce:

## Node: Stop Live Chat

As soon as the user is finished with the agent conversation, this node can be used to stop the curent live agent session. One needs the `liveAgentAffinity` and `liveAgentSessionKey` which were stored into the context before. After executing this node, the Salesforce Live Agent chat will end and the node will return `true`.

## Node: Send Message To Live Agent

In order to send a message to the current live agent session, this node is required. One needs the `liveAgentAffinity` and `liveAgentSessionKey` which were stored into the context before -- by **Start Live Chat**. Furthermore, a `text` message must be defined. After sending a message, this node doesn't return anything.

## Node: Get Agent Message (BETA)

At the moment, you need to use this node in order to retreive sent agent messages. One needs the `liveAgentAffinity` and `liveAgentSessionKey` which were stored into the context before -- by **Start Live Chat**. Behind the scenes, this Node polls for a new Salesforce message and automatically sends it to the user as soon as it arrives.

In your Cognigy Flow, this process could look like this:
