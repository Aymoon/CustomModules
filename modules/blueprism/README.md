# Blue Prism

This Custom Module integrated Blue Prism RPA with Cognigy.AI. 

## Set up Blue Prism Test Server

If you want to test the Custom Module using your already developed Blue Pism processes, you have to enable the Web Service. After starting Blue Prism locally on your personal computer, go to the command prompt and type in the following: `"C:\Program Files\Blue Prism Limited\Blue Prism Automate\Automate.exe" /resourcepc /public`. This will start the service on your computer. Now you are also able to use this compuer as resource in the conntrol room.

Help:
